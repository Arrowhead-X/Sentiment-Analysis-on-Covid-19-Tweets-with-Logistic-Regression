# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Covid-19-Tweets-with-Logistic-Regression

The probability of your organisation's increased market share only increases if your brand itself becomes top of mind for current and prospective customers.
A popular brand =/= A great/desired brand, as populartity could mean putting on one of two hats (Negative/Positive). When this concept is properly understood, your
goal then becomes to ensure that your brand popularity takes an upward trajectory while putting on the positive hat.

How then do you know what hat your organisation's popularity currently rocks? You don't, except you measure. While we may not be able to outrightly measure the
positivity or negativity of your brand's popularity, we can definitely measure quantitative attributes related to your brand, one of which is a measure of your
brand's *Positive* to *Negative* sentiment ratio i.e., what are the great things being said about your brand versus the negative things being said about your brand.

We could even go ahead to establish a middle ground for sentiments that we do not consider either negative or positve and refer to them as *Neutral* sentiment.
A thorough understanding of what is being said about you by your customers allows you to see the areas of your business and strategues that require urgent attention/review
and areas of your business that should be maintained and improved on. This process right here is made possible through sentiment analysis with machine learning.

Sentiment analysis allows us to feed extracted data from reviews, posts, tweets etc about our brand on social media to a machine learning model that assigns scores
to each review/comment, classifying each one as either *Negative*, *Neutral* or *Positive*. The following project demonstrates how we use a machine learning algorithm
*Logistic Regression* to understand the nature of comments that some twitter users made about the **Covid-19 pandemic.**
